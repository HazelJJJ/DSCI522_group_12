Decision Making:
We can vote to get a final decision
Decision making by democracy; if tie, discuss further
I think we should discuss the matters and everyone’s ideas should be appreciated even if they sound immature.
Proposal of ideas are encouraged and discussed on slack consistently
Voting for final decision (could be anon or not)

Conflict:
Direct conflict with person: 1st discuss with the one person; 2nd bring to group; 3rd bring to instructor
I think if there is a conflict, we should all discuss it and try to solve it together.

Every week, a randomly selected (since some weeks are busier than others) group member is responsible for organizing meeting on zoom when necessary, and write and uploading meeting minutes to Github issues
