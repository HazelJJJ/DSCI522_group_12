## Summary

## Introduction

In recent years, credit card becomes more and more popular in Taiwan. Because card-issuing banks are all trying to increase market share, there exists more unqualified applicants who are not able to pay their credit card on time. This behaviour is very harmful to both banks and cardholders. (#reference) It is always better to prevent than to solve a problem. By detecting patterns of people who tend to default their credit card payment, banks are able to minimize the risk of issuing credict card to people who may not be able to pay on time.

Here we would like to use a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a person is going to defualt on his/her credit card payment. We are going to test on different model and hyperparameters to find the best score on prediction. With the model, banks could predict if the applicant has the ability to pay on time and make better decision on whether to issue the person a credit card. Thus, if the machine learning algorithm can make accurate prediction, banks are able to find reliable applicants and minimize their loss on default payment. 

## Methods

### Data

The dataset we are using in the project is originally from Department of Information Management in Chun Hua University, Taiwan and Department of Civil Engineering in Tamkang University, Taiwan. It was sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository (#references) and can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients#). [This file](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00350/default%20of%20credit%20card%20clients.xls) is what we used to build the model. The data set contains 30,000 observations representing individual customers in Taiwan. Each row contains relevant information about the distinct individual as well as how timely they were with their bill payments and the corresponding bill amounts for each time period. The bill payment information contains records from April 2005 to September 2005 and each individual have the same number of time periods. The data was collected from an important cash and credit card issuing bank in Taiwan.We will make our prediction based on the features given by the data.

### Analysis

There are 30,000 observations of distinct credit card clients in this data set with each row represents a client. 25 different feature are included with information of each given client, such as gender, age, approved credit limit, education, marital status, their past payment history, bill statements, and previous payments for 6 months (April-Sept 2005). Feature transformations are applied to the given features so each observation has the same number of time periods. [Here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522_group_12/blob/main/src/project_eda.md) is a more detailed exploratory analysis that explained how we transform and use each feature.There exists class imbalance in the data set, and one pattern we found is that people with higher credit card limit are more likely to default their payment.    


```{r limit plot, fig.cap='Figure 1. Density of Credit Limit Between Default Clients and On-time Clients', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('../results/density_plot.png')
```

Both `LogisticRegression` and `RandomForest` model will be used to build this classification model to predict whether a client will default on the credit card payment. Because of the class imbalance we have, we will look at test accuracy as well as f1 scores on both model. For each model, the appropriate hyperparameters were chosen using 5-fold cross validation. The R and Python programing languages and the following R and Python packages were used to perform the analysis:  ...ADD packages and ref.

The code used to perform the analysis and create this report can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522_group_12/tree/main/src)
